# Education
* Doctor of Philosophy (Climate Science) 	2019 - present
  University of New South Wales, Sydney
  **Supervisors:** Alex Sen Gupta, Andréa Taschetto and Ming Feng
  **Thesis:** A Lagrangian analysis of tropical Pacific Ocean physical and biogeochemical projected changes
  This study investigates how and why the complex interplay of physical and biogeochemical processes in the tropical Pacific are projected to change in a future of increasing greenhouse emissions. We use Lagrangian particles combined with an iron model to examine long-term future changes to the sources and pathways of Equatorial Undercurrent water transport and nutrients in the tropical Pacific Ocean.

* Bachelor of Science (Honours, Climate Science), Honours Class 1 	2018
  University of New South Wales, Sydney
  **Supervisors:** Alex Sen Gupta and Andréa Taschetto
  **Thesis:** Projected circulation changes of the South Indian Ocean
  This study examines hindcasts and ‘business as usual’ future changes to large-scale South Indian Ocean dynamics, using an ensemble of 28 climate models. We compare the ensemble mean volume transports to observations and explore ensemble spread, single model interannual variabilities, Sverdrup dynamics and future changes to gain insight into causes of variabilities and future changes.

* Bachelor of Science (Physical Oceanography and Physics) 2010 - 2017
