# Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent sources

Lagrangian particles regularly initialized within the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and back-tracked to their source using daily mean OFAM3 velocity fields.
The animation runs backwards from 2012 in increments of 2 days for around 6 years.
The particle colours indicate their source location (shown by thick coloured lines around boundary).
The lines represent particle positions over a 6 day period, so longer lines indicate faster particles (i.e. travelled a further distance in the same amount of days) and vice versa.


The particle trajectories were calculated using the [OceanParcels library](https://oceanparcels.org) and the animation was created using python matplotlib.<br>
