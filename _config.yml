author-about: >
  PhD Candidate at the Climate Change Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>About</strong>
  <br/><br/>
  My research interests include understanding how climate change will impact ocean circulation and biogeochemistry, 
  developing software tools for climate research and improving climate models.
  <br/><br/>
  My PhD research examines model representation and future changes of circulation and iron in the tropical Pacific. 
  I used particle-tracking methods to understand how the complex mix of multi-decadal projected changes in this region are connected. 
  I also simuated the effects of circulation changes on nutrient supply to the equatorial Pacific by developing a semi-Lagrangian iron model.
  <br/><br/>
  Previously, I investigated the expected future changes of ocean currents in the Pacific
  and Indian Ocean and the major western boundary currents including the Gulf Stream,
  Kuroshio Current and East Australian Current using over 60 coupled climate models.
  <br/><br/>
  I am in the final year of a PhD in Climate Science and completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in
  Physics and Maths (Physical Oceanography) with honours in Climate Science at UNSW, Sydney.
  <br/><br/>
  Please contact me if you would like to discuss my research on ocean circulation, CMIP and observational datasets, teaching resources for marine heatwaves or python code for particle-tracking experiments.
