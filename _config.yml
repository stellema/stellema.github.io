  Research Engineer at CSIRO in Hobart, Australia.

  <strong>About</strong>
  <br/><br/>
  
  My current research involves analysing extreme events in large ensembles and researching ways to improve hazard early warning systems.
  <br/><br/>
  I'm also interested in understanding the impact of climate change on tropical ocean circulation and the implications for marine ecosystems. 
  My most recent research uses particle-tracking methods to understand how and why circulation in the tropical Pacific is projected to change and 
  the effect of circulation changes on the supply of iron to the equatorial Pacific using a semi-Lagrangian iron model (manuscripts in prep).
  <br/><br/>
  I have also investigated future changes of upper-ocean circulation in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Ocean in over 60 coupled climate models.
  <br/><br/>
  Some of my other research interests include making 3D data visualisations, circulation schematics and tracking synoptic features.
  <br/><br/>
  I have a PhD in Climate Science and a Bachelor of Science majoring in Physics and Maths (Physical Oceanography) with honours in Climate Science at UNSW, Sydney.
